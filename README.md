Efficient Frontier Project Assignment

Primary Objective: For this project, you will select a basket of seven (7) assets, calculate their individual 
risk/return value, combine these into the efficient frontier, and then graph the results.



Background: The Markowitz Efficient Frontier theory, or Mean-Variance Theory, is a fundamental theory of
portfolio management. The mean-variance portfolio theory says that any investor will choose the optimal portfolio
from the set of portfolios that:
      > Maximize expected return for a given level of risk, and
      > Minimize risk for a given level of expected return
The outcome of risk-return combinations generated by portfolios of risky assets gives you the minimum variance for a given rate of return.

The efficient frontier is the set of mean-variance combinations from the minimum-variance frontier where, for a
given risk, no other portfolio offers a higher expected return:
